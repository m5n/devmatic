# devmatic: the automated developer
An attempt to make myself obsolete. Computer programs--at the most fundamental level--respond to events. What if, based on a description of events, a computer program could be generated automatically?

## Plan
Since I'm a UI programmer, I'll start with the UI layer.

1. DSL for JS-style browser-based events (click, hover, drag, etc.)
2. DSL for CSS (styling, animations)
3. DSL for Backend API (REST AJAX calls)
4. Ability to generate code for specific frameworks (Angular, Backbone, etc.)
5. Ability to generate code for non-browsers, e.g. Andoid, iOS
6. Stick with generated code or write a browser plugin that converts DSL into an actual UI... or compile directly into browser code base?

## Wishlist

Expand to non-UI applications.

1. Server-side components
2. Non-HTTP applications (car, file system, elevator control system, etc.)
